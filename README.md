The program analyzes HTML and finds a specific element, even after changes, using a set of extracted attributes.

The program must consume the original page to collect all the required information about the target element. 
Then the program should be able to find this element in diff-case HTML document that differs a bit from the original page. 
Original and diff-case HTML documents should be provided to the program in each run - no persistence is required.
